 *   Standard, 1st Working Draft - June 2008"
 *
 * The working draft is available on the IPC website.
 *
 * The following parts of the standard are covered by the implementation:
 *   - Land pattern dimension and spacing calculations
 *   - Courtyard properties
 *
 * These parts are not implemented:
 *   - Land pattern naming convention
 *
 * Note also that the following items are not part of IPC-7251 draft 1 or this
 * implementation:
 *   - Silk screen
 *   - Assembly outline
